## State Transitions

### Digital Twin States
- **Initialization**: Digital twin is being set up with basic parameters
- **Configuration**: Parameters, models, and sensors are being defined
- **Ready**: All components are configured, waiting for simulation start
- **Running**: Simulation is active and producing data
- **Paused**: Simulation is temporarily stopped
- **Error**: Simulation encountered an error and stopped
- **Terminated**: Simulation has been properly shut down

### State Transition Rules
- Initialization → Configuration: When all basic parameters are set
- Configuration → Ready: When all models and sensors are properly defined
- Ready → Running: When simulation is started
- Running → Paused: When pause is requested
- Paused → Running: When resume is requested
- Running/Paused → Error: When an error occurs
- Running/Paused → Ready: When reset is requested
- Any state → Terminated: When simulation is properly shut down
