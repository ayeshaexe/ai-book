## State Transition Rules

### Simulation State Transitions
- Initialization → Configuration: When environment parameters are set
- Configuration → Running: When simulation is started
- Running ↔ Paused: When pause/resume is requested
- Any state → Error: When an error occurs
- Any state → Terminated: When simulation is properly shut down

### Navigation State Transitions
- Idle → Planning: When a navigation goal is received
- Planning → Executing: When a valid path is computed
- Executing → Succeeded: When goal is reached
- Executing → Planning: When replanning is needed (obstacles, etc.)
- Executing → Recovering: When recovery behavior is triggered
- Any → Cancelled: When navigation is cancelled
- Recovering → Executing: When recovery succeeds
- Recovering → Idle: When recovery fails
