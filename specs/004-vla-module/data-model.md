# Data Model: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## Key Entities

### Voice Command
- **Description**: Natural language instruction provided by user through speech
- **Attributes**:
  - text: string (transcribed speech content)
  - confidence: float (Whisper's confidence in transcription)
  - timestamp: datetime (when command was received)
  - user_intent: string (parsed intent from the command)
  - parameters: object (extracted parameters from the command)

### Cognitive Plan
- **Description**: Sequence of robotic actions generated by LLM based on natural language understanding
- **Attributes**:
  - id: string (unique identifier for the plan)
  - commands: array (sequence of ROS 2 action commands)
  - dependencies: array (order dependencies between commands)
  - estimated_duration: float (estimated time to execute the plan)
  - safety_constraints: array (safety checks to validate before execution)
  - status: enum (pending, validated, executing, completed, failed)

### ROS 2 Action
- **Description**: Specific robot command or behavior that executes part of the cognitive plan
- **Attributes**:
  - action_type: string (type of action: navigation, manipulation, perception)
  - parameters: object (specific parameters for the action)
  - target_pose: object (position/orientation for navigation actions)
  - object_id: string (identifier for manipulation targets)
  - execution_status: enum (pending, executing, succeeded, failed, cancelled)
  - feedback: object (real-time feedback during execution)

### Humanoid Robot State
- **Description**: Current state of the humanoid robot during VLA execution
- **Attributes**:
  - position: object (current position in 3D space)
  - orientation: object (current orientation/rotation)
  - joint_positions: array (positions of all robot joints)
  - battery_level: float (remaining battery percentage)
  - current_task: string (currently executing task)
  - safety_status: enum (safe, warning, error)
  - sensor_data: object (current data from robot sensors)

### Interaction Context
- **Description**: Context information for maintaining conversation and task continuity
- **Attributes**:
  - conversation_id: string (identifier for the current conversation)
  - history: array (previous commands and responses)
  - current_objectives: array (current goals being pursued)
  - environmental_map: object (map of the environment)
  - object_locations: array (locations of relevant objects)
  - user_preferences: object (preferences for interaction style)
